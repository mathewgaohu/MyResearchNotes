# CCGO servers

First you need to ssh ccgo1.

## 1. To use conda
```
source /workspace/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate hippylib2019
```
You can also put the source command in your `.bashrc` file so it runs automatically when you ssh in. First do
```
vim ~/.bashrc
```
this file indicates the commands that you want to run when you log in. So, add the source command here. You are all set.
